<h1>Week 5: Dithering and Convolution</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Written in Processing 4.3
Processing Video library installation required. 


<h2>Weekly Task</h2>
In this task, you will implement a real-time image processing system using your webcam. Combine a dithering algorithm with one of the filters we looked at last week. The processed image should update continuously as the webcam feed changes, showing both the dithering effect and the selected filter. Use the saveFrame function to make a story reel of up to 10 pictures like in a comic book.

**Filters:** Apply filters to images, including thresholding, brightness, contrast, inversion, and duotone to an image by manipulating pixel values, use lerpColor to blend between colour variables
