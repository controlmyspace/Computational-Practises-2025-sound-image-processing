<h1>Week 4: Filtering Images</h1>

Generate a 2D landscape using Perlin Noise and apply a duotone color effect based on the terrain heights. The goal is to understand how to blend two colors smoothly based on the terrain values, creating a visually interesting landscape with dynamic color transitions.
Sketch Goals: how might you use noise to animate the terrain.
