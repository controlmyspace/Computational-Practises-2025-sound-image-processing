<h1>Week 10: Particle Systems</h1>

<h2>Weekly Task</h2>
Create an interactive sketch implementing Particle Systems and ArrayLists.
The sketch should have: at least 3 vectors (PVector) for each particle: location, velocity, acceleration, at least one type of user interaction impacting the system, at least 1 randomised force impacting the system (e.g. wind).

Feel free to use the optional prompts below: Petals falling from blossom tress, Leaves falling in the autumn, Snow, Cosmic explosion, cosmic dust or falling stars, Sea creatures such as plankton.
Please note as particles are points, you can use a graphic asset or a custom drawing for display if you want to.
