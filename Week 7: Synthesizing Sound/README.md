<h1>Week 7: Synthesizing Sound</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

 - Download Minim audio library for Processing
 - Download audio files
 - Drum sounds sampled from: <a href="https://samplefocus.com/">Sample Sound </a> 
 

<h2>Weekly Task</h2>

Using at least 4 samples, create a drum pattern. Make the pattern change in time. You could do that by: - adding an element of randomness to at least one of the samples, - alternate the pattern depending on time, e.g. count bars based on frameCount, seconds or milliseconds

How to start (optional prompts):

Pick some samples from the resources below (or find or record your own), and modify the example from class using them.
Pick a drum pattern or a beat from a song from the examples below (or your own example), and try to replicate it. If you're a beginner, replicating one of these would be a good start: Essential drum patterns (for hip hop).
Design your own beat using clapping, visuals, or however you like, and try to replicate it.

(Optional). Can you add an audio-reactive visualisation? For this, you may want to increase the frameRate to achieve a smooth animation. For example, if you want the music to play at 120 bpm, which is 2 times per second, set the frameRate to 60 and play the base sound every 30th frame (frameCount % 30 == 0). (Advanced). Can you combine sound synthesised with an oscillator (task from last week) with looped samples in a single piece of music?

<h2>Design Notes</h2>

- four audio sample files: hihat, crash, kick, snare

- randomness: tempo gradually slows down over time

- audio-reactive visual: pulsing circle which is audio sensitive

- BMP indicator visually implemented

- quite random & unpleasant drum pattern/sound
